# PWM_drawer
❑ PWM drawer works as a mini oscilloscope that is responsible  for printing the frequency and the waveform of the generated  PWM signal. ❑ The generated wave came from two sources, external sources  (e.g. generated PWM from other MCs), or internal source of  the Microcontroller of the project itself.
